# Project Euler solutions in Haskell

You can clone and build the project with: `./build.sh <problem-number>`

Example:

```
$ ./build.sh 1
233168
```

Source code for each solution lives in the [solutions](./solutions) folder

The main goal of this project is:
- Learning to think functional
  (simple by design, low mental overhead, maintainable code)
- Extend this functional world to my life as developer
  (reliable, secure, correct, scalable software)
- Understand really well the logical foundations of each problem
  (analysis and implementation)

Haskell was chosen because it's the purest functional language out there.
Once you can solve problems in Haskell
extending such knowledge to _regular_ languages becomes natural.
